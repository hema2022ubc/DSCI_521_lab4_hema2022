####Graphene is a single layer of two-dimensional atomic crystals with an orthohexagonal lattice structure. The length of the C–C bond is around 0.142 nm, and the thickness of the layer is 0.35 nm.

#The electronic property of graphene



###The dispersion relation of graphene

$$E(k_x,k_y)=\pm\,\gamma_0\sqrt{1+4\cos^2{\tfrac{1}{2}ak_x}+4\cos{\tfrac{1}{2}ak_x} \cdot \cos{\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}ak_y}}$$
